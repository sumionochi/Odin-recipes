    <h2><i><b># Description</b></i></h2>
    Pav bhaji is an iconic dish from Mumbai and hugely popular all over India as a street food. It first originated in Mumbai as a quick lunch option for textile mill workers.

Gradually this dish becomes so popular that now it is served as street food as well as in restaurants in Mumbai and the rest of India.

In Hindi and Marathi languages, the word “Pav” is for bread rolls. “Bhaji” means vegetables or a vegetable based dish (dry or gravy) in the Marathi language. Since both the bhaji (vegetable gravy) and pav (dinner rolls) are served together, hence the name ‘Pav Bhaji‘.

Bhaji is basically a mix of mashed and spiced vegetables in a tangy flavorful spiced gravy. A special spice mix called ‘Pav Bhaji Masala‘ is used to make this dish. Pav bhaji masala powder is easily available in Indian stores and online but can be made at home too.

    <ul>
        <li><b>Mix Vegetables</b><br>I add a mix of veggies like cauliflower, carrots, potatoes, capsicum and green peas. The Mumbai street side versions do not have carrots, but I add them for health reasons. They also add very less amount of cauliflower and sometimes omit it completely.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Green Peas</b><br>I always add fresh or frozen green peas. The street side bhaji has dried green or white peas which are cooked and mashed. The dried green peas give a different taste and consistency to the bhaji. Feel free to include dried green peas in this recipe.</li><br>
        <li><b>Butter</b><br>I personally prefer to use the Indian brand of Amul butter for the bhaji, but you could use any brand or even white butter.</li><br>
        <li><b>Bhaji Masala</b><br>This is a special spice blend that is added into the bhaji. Either buy a good brand of make your own following my recipe of Pav Bhaji Masala.</li><br>
        <li><b>Pav (Dinner Rolls)</b><br>Pav are soft, fluffy dinner rolls. For the pav you can either make them at home or buy from a good bakery. I usually make Pav a day before when I decide to make pav bhaji or when I have Misal Pav on the menu. For health reasons, you can opt for whole wheat dinner rolls.</li>
