    <h2><i><b># Description</b></i></h2>
    One of my favorite recipes to make over is the delicious dosa. I love these crispy, flaky, healthy circles of lentil-and-rice goodness with a passion. Perhaps it's because I am an honorary Tamilian (believe me, I know more ingredient names in Tamil than Desi does, and Tamil’s his mother tongue. Ha!). Or maybe it’s just that dosas are a perfect combination of healthy meets delicious, which makes it the perfect food for a foodie health nut. And they are perfect for a tasty Indian breakfast or lunch.

     <h2><i><b># Instructions</b></i></h2>
     <list>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Make Potato Sabzi</b>
            <ol>
                <li>Boil the potatoes in their jackets until a fork inserted in the thickest portion goes cleanly through. Dice the potatoes into a fairly small dice. I leave the skins on because I love them, but you can peel your potatoes if you'd rather.</li>
                <li>Heat the oil in a wok or a large saucepan</li>
                <li>Add the mustard seeds and when they crackle, add the red chili peppers and onions.</li>
                <li>Saute, stirring frequently, until the onion just starts to turn color</li>
                <li>Add the ginger and saute a few more seconds. Add the diced bell peppers and ground black pepper.</li>
                <li>Cook, stirring occasionally, for about five minutes or until the peppers start to soften. Add the potatoes.</li>
                <li>Let the potatoes cook over medium-high heat until they start to form a crust at the bottom. Stir a few times so they don't stick. With a potato masher or a heavy ladle, mash the potatoes slightly.</li>
                <li>Season with salt and stir in the lemon juice.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle the cilantro and mix.
                </li>
            </ol></li>
            <br>

            <li><b>Make the masala dosa</b></li>
            <ol>
            <li>Mix the flours, baking soda and salt in a bowl with enough water to make a runny batter. You want something far runnier than a pancake batter because you want to spread it fairly thin.</li>
            <li>Heat a griddle over medium-high heat. Using a round-bottomed ladle, pour about half a cup of batter into the center of the griddle. Quickly, spread outward in a circular motion with the bottom of the ladle. You want your dosa to be fairly thin if you like it crispy.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle or spray some oil around the edges. Cook until the top is dry and the edges are browned. Remove to a plate.</li>
            <li>Place the stuffing inside the dosa, fold over, and serve with chutney.</li>
            </ol>
        </ul>
